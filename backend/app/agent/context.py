"""What this one call is about. Assembled once, before the phone rings.

Nothing here is re-injected mid-conversation. The prompt is composed at call setup and
then stays fixed for the life of the call, which is what makes a transcript replayable:
the same context and the same audio produce the same reasoning.

These are *rendering inputs*, not the domain model. When domain/Operation and
domain/Mandate land in policy's hands, the composer maps from them into this — deliberately,
so that adding a field to the mandate does not silently change what the agent says.
